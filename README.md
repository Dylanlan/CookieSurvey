CookieSurvey
============

Automatically fills out subway surveys for free cookies

Back story: I go to subway 5 times a week, and always fill out their online survey to get a free cookie. I got sick of filling it out manually, so I wrote this program to save me about 30 seconds every day.

Note: This program uses my own survey answers, and sends to my email. If anyone else uses this, you should change the source code to use whichever store number is on your receipt, whichever answers you want to give to the survey, and whichever emails you want to send it to.

To use, make sure you have a google chrome tab opened to the subway survey found at www.tellsubway.com

It will then fill in the store code '25544' and submit

It will open a form for you to input the date and time of the receipt

If 'Cancel' is clicked, the program will exit

If 'Ok' is clicked, it will then submit the information into the survey

Current version does not submit the final survey yet.

Future changes hope to include:
- Asking for store code, survey preferences, and emails once, which is saved across executions
- Opening the subway survey if it wasn't found
